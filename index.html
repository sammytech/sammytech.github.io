    <h2 class="sub-section">About Me</h2>
    <p>
      I am a person who is not afraid to try new technologies even if there are limited resourses to learn
      said technology. I started programming around the age of 12 in Nigeria. My first programming experience
      was with HTML, but after few weeks of using HTML, I decided to try programming in Visual Basic. I learned
      HTML by reading a powerpoint I stumbled upon in a CD, and Visual Basic by reading and memorizing
      source code and wathcing a programmer who learned Visual Basic through a IT training program. He
      never personally taught me anything. Self-teaching without the aid of the internet or a textbook
      was difficult but fun at the same time.
    </p>
    <p>
      My first major project was made using Visual Basic around the age of 13. I developed a desktop
      application which allowed a user to login. The system then allows the user to keep inventory, also they
      are able to create transactions in the application. This program was inteded to be used to help
      my mother keep a digital record of her transactions in her computer business. The system stored
      data by using Microsoft Accces.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, this project and its goal were not completed becasue at the age of 14 I moved to the United
      States of America. Since then, I have been involved in numerous projects. Some were completed, and other not.
