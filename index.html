                A group project for our Object Oriented Software Development class. We were required
                to develop a system which allowed libary administrators to create and modify books, workers
                and student borrowers. Also, the system allowed for checking in and checking out of books.
                The system supported internalization(French and English). I worked as the main developer and designer.

      <h2 class="sub-section">About Me</h2>
      <p>
        I am a person who is not afraid to try new technologies even if there are limited resourses to learn
        said technology. I started programming around the age of 12 in Nigeria. My first programming experience
        was with HTML, but after few weeks of using HTML, I decided to try programming in Visual Basic. I learned
        HTML by reading a powerpoint I stumbled upon in a CD, and Visual Basic by reading and memorizing
        source code and watching a programmer who learned Visual Basic through a IT training program. He
        never personally taught me anything. Self-learning without the aid of the internet or a textbook
        was difficult but fun at the same time.
      </p>
      <p>
        My first major project was created using Visual Basic around the age of 13. I developed a desktop
        application which allowed a user to login. The system then allows the user to keep inventory, also they
        are able to create transactions in the application. This program was inteded to be used to help
        my mother keep a digital record of her transactions in her computer business. The system stored
        data by using Microsoft Accces.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, this project and its goal were not completed because at the age of 14 I moved to the United
        States of America. Since then, I have been involved in numerous projects. Some were completed, and others not.
